    <h1>Pier NY</h1>
    <div class="essay container">
    <p>For the whole time that I’ve lived in Brooklyn, which is most of my life, Pier 5 has always been a place I love to go to to play soccer and enjoy the beauty of New York City. From the perfect soccer fields, the sound of the waves of the Atlantic ocean hitting the Pier, to the beautiful sunset over a view of Manhattan, Pier 5 has always been a place to truly see the city’s beauty physically and spiritually.</p>
    <p>This pier might have little importance to many people in New York, but for me, it’s my favorite place to go to admire the sheer beauty of the city. When I’m there I see the amazing view of the towering Manhattan skyline and the reflection of the sunset over the Atlantic ocean. I see groups of people on the soccer fields, forgetting all of their problems and regrouping together to play a sport that they love and the people hanging out at the picnic tables, enjoying their ice creams after a hot day, and I see families cooking meat at the barbeques enjoying their night. I can hear the sound of the waves crashing against the pier, the shouts of the soccer players, celebrating or asking for the ball, people singing happy birthday at the picnic tables, helicopters flying overhead, and the rare call of a seagull. I smell hot dogs and burgers, the sweaty athletes, the steam from the boats unloading their cargo, and the salty ocean. I can taste ice cream and lemonade, barbecued meat, vegetable skewers, and the cold water from the fountain after a long day of running. I feel the soft turf through my fingers, the ocean breeze occasionally relieving me from the summer heat, the bright warm sun, and the cramps in my legs at the end of the day. Pier 5 is an experience and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't lived it yet. </p>
    <p>Pier 5 is also a place that brings people together and creates bonds and friendships. Due to its amazing surroundings, (view, water, brooklyn bridge park) these soccer fields are very popular and attract many people. Too many for people to play in their own little groups of friends. Since thousands of people come and go there everyday, strangers are forced to share the fields and play soccer together. Playing team games with people you’ve never met before forces friendships to form because it demands communication and teamwork. Since it’s hard to have a bad experience there, most people always come back and you always end up seeing people you’ve played with last time you were there. Eventually, you play with the same strangers again and again until they aren't really strangers anymore.</p>
    <p>Pier 5 is most importantly a place that truly portrays New York City in its fullest, as it shows diversity and how nobody can ever get bored in the concrete jungle. When I am there, I can see all types of people all regrouping to partake in an activity they love, with people they’ve never met before. For me, that is the reality of NYC as it is one of the most diverse places in the world. Not only that, but around Pier 5, there are many other things to do which shows how people can never get bored in this city. Pier 5 is part of a park called Brooklyn Bridge Park, where there are many other piers for different types of activities. There is a beach volleyball pier, a basketball pier, a grassy area to sit in and enjoy the view, unique swings where even adults can have fun, and an elevated pizzeria that makes the best pizza I’ve ever had, even better than when I went to Italy. One time when I was there, my friend kicked the soccer ball over the big nets preventing that from happening and the brand new soccer ball fell into the water. After thinking about what to do, he took of his shirt and jumped into the cold ocean. We got the ball and everybody was happy but that’s not the point. Crazy stories always happen there and it shows the mess that pier 5 is. Evidently, it’s hard to get bored there, and the same goes for NYC, which truly represents what the city is about.</p>
